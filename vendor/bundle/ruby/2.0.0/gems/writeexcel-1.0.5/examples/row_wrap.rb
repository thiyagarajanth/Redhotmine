# Demonstrates how to wrap data from one worksheet onto another.
#
# Excel has a row limit of 65536 rows. Sometimes the amount of row data to be
# written to a file is greater than this limit. In this case it is a useful
# technique to wrap the data from one worksheet onto the next so that we get
# something like the following:
#
#   Sheet1  Row     1  -  65536
#   Sheet2  Row 65537  - 131072
#   Sheet3  Row 131073 - ...
#
# In order to achieve this we use a single worksheet reference and
# reinitialise it to point to a new worksheet when required.

require 'writeexcel'

workbook  = WriteExcel.new('row_wrap.xls')
worksheet = workbook.add_worksheet

# Worksheet formatting.
worksheet.set_column('A:A', 20)

# For the sake of this example we will use a small row limit. In order to use
# the entire row range set the row_limit to 65536.
row_limit = 10
row       = 0

(1 .. 2 * row_limit + 10).each do |count|
  # When we hit the row limit we redirect the output
  # to a new worksheet and reset the row number.
  if row == row_limit
    worksheet = workbook.add_worksheet
    row = 0

    # Repeat any worksheet formatting.
    worksheet.set_column('A:A', 20)
  end
  worksheet.write(row, 0,  "This is row #{count}")
  row += 1
end

workbook.close
