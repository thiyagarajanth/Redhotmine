# The general syntax is write(row, column, token). Note that row and
# column are zero indexed
#

# Write some text
worksheet.write(0, 0,  "Hi Excel!")


# Write some numbers
worksheet.write(2, 0,  3)          # Writes 3
worksheet.write(3, 0,  3.00000)    # Writes 3
worksheet.write(4, 0,  3.00001)    # Writes 3.00001
worksheet.write(5, 0,  3.14159)    # TeX revision no.?


# Write some formulas
worksheet.write(7, 0,  '=A3 + A6')
worksheet.write(8, 0,  '=IF(A5>3,"Yes", "No")')
