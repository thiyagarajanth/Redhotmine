= groupmanager


This plugin provide a project's tab of group management. Redmine administrator allow project roles of  users (not 
redmine admins) to change group's membership, view,  create or delete admin created groups or other user's groups. Permissions of operations on groups are managed from role's permissions tab in Administration menu.
Adding or deleteing users are allowed in scope of project. 
Works with redmine 2.2.3
In my installation users have custom fields Department and Position. If you've got user custom fields, they will be displayed in group view.
Note: You can't add user, wich is not project member. (It's an administrator privelege..)
